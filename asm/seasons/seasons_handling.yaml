seasons:
  # Natzu and Samasa Desert are summer only, and goron mountain is winter only. 
  # Northern Peak doesn't matter (it might become spring after you beat the game).
  # Note that these names don't correspond 1:1 with the names used on the overworld map, 
  # which aren't delineated based on season boundaries.

  # This function aims to fix season handling for Subrosia -> interior map warps
  # There are two occurences of this in the game
  # 1) Subrosia -> Horon warp (mainly for Fixed Horon Season setting)
  # 2) Subrosia -> Upper Temple Remains warp (to put back default Temple Remains season when coming from that portal)
