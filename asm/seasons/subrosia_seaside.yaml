  # check room flags to determine whether to create star ore instead of
  # whatever global flag 0e is. this also fixes a vanilla bug causing star ore
  # to be infinitely rediggable (but only when the first screen is rolled? or
  # that getting it on the first screen doesn't count? something). this is here
  # since there's no room in bank 8.
